Welcome to Genshin Wiki!
This current program acts like a search engine for newer Genshin Players.

Updates are to be expected of this program when the game keeps updating.<br/>
※ You are free to change up the code as much as your want when using this program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
※ Instructions ※
1. Go ahead and download either **GenshinImpact.exe** or **GenshinImpact.zip**.
2. If you have downloaded **GenshinImpact.exe**, run the file and when it asks for administrator press Yes.
   - Your files should be automatically downloaded and you should be able to see an executable file.
3. If you have downloaded **GenshinImpact.zip**, unzip the file.
   - After unzipping your files you should be able to see an executable file.
4. Run the executable file and you should be able to interact with the code straight away.
   - Keep in mind that the program will only take in the corresponding letters that it has; **[a,b,c,d]**.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, as of now, there is no Mac version of the executable file as making a DMG file through a windows computer directly is impossible without a third-party app.
