# Genshin Wiki for Characters and more

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<main.py> is the main file of what you will need in order to run the file
   - <utility.py> is an essential file that is needed for this program to work as the <main.py> imports the information from <utility.py>

<genshinCharacters.txt> is a file that was used to check which characters are in Genshin Impact in order to code more efficiently. 


All sources comes from the websites below:

    - https://genshin.gg/

    - https://game8.co/games/Genshin-Impact

    - https://gamewith.net/genshin-impact/


This code may undergo future updates as Genshin Impact updates.

   4. Make sure your python3 interpreter is at its latest by downloading the lastest python version
      - You can download the latest python in: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   5. Run your code and make sure that <utility_class.py> is linked with <main.py> in order to have the code working properly.
